## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📋 Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (or yarn)
- Python 3.x
- Conda
- Poetry (Python package manager)

### 🖥️ Project Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/panda-etl.git
   cd panda-etl
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies (including Husky):

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the frontend directory with the following:

   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000/api/v1
   NEXT_PUBLIC_STORAGE_URL=http://localhost:3000/api/assets
   ```

   or copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`

4. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:

   ```bash
